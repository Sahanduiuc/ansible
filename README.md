Tony's Personal Ansible Repo
===================

Introduction
-----------
This repo is a dumping ground for my personal Ansible playbooks.  I
have written several playbooks for building out environment on virtual
machines.  Most of these virtual machines are used for doing data
analytics for science and engineering or for building automated
trading systems.

The playbooks are fairly simple and straightforward.  I typically
will keep environment build-out playbooks contained in one YAML file
as opposed to using the Ansible developer's suggested [directory
structures](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout).  I do this for the sake of simplicity. 

Also, I do not have any inventory files located within this repo.
That should be pretty self explanatory as to why I do not do this.

Feel free to use any of these, but use them at your own risk.
Probably best to think of these as examples to build your own
playbooks as I am sure the version numbers of the specific
applications may not be what you want them to be.
